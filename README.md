## Objectives and Outcomes

This is my 2nd Full Stack app made using Node/Express + MongoDB. I tried to do the upload challenge and it somewhat works.

Some of the hurdles along the way:

1. This is still my 2nd Express App so doing all the models, views, and controllers without looking at cheatsheets was a challenge.

2. The hardest part of this one for me is about uploading images. I used `multer` and in the end, I tried to convert images to strings via image buffers and store them to MongoDB.

3 As always, the User Interface. Not really a boss this time around and CSS is getting easier day by day.

## Usage / Running the Project Locally.

1. Clone the repository. (git clone ...)
2. Install/Update node_modules in the project directory. (npm install)
3. Run the app. (npm run devstart)

## Development

Made with mainly:

- NodeJS
- Express JS
- MongoDB as Database.
- `multer` for file upload middleware
